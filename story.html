            <p>
              We met in 2018 playing flag American Football at Cedar Grove
              Football Field. Sven was impressed with Abbi's speed on the field,
              Abbi was impressed with Sven's beard.
            </p>
            <p>
              We went for a late night shawarma at Casa Nova one night after a
              game and the rest is history!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id='sven_text' class='text'>
            <p>
              Sven and Abbi met at Cedar Grover Playing field one night, when
              they both arrived for a game of Flag Football. After brief
              introductions, Sven thought he'd impress Abbi by placing her
              strong but unusual accent. "Are you from Newcastle?" he
              confidently guessed.
            </p>
            <p>
              So enamoured with Sven's charm and boyish good looks was Abbi,
              that she humoured him even though he was miles off: "No Hull,
              but you're close!"
            </p>
            <p>
              Sven and Abbi played a few games of flag football together over
              the following weeks, where despite her impressive speed, Abbi
              could not have caught a cold, let alone the ball.
            </p>
            <p>
              After games would wrap up Abbi would often detail her extensive
              hunger to Sven. Thinking 10PM an odd time to eat, but always
              ready to help, Sven would direct her to late-night eateries
              around the island.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sven, not being the most perceptive of people, didn't realise that
              it was not food, but his company that Abbi was hungry for. Seeing
              that subtly was not the route to Sven's heart, Abbi eventually
              asked him to join her for a bite and chat after a game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dumbfounded by the offer, Sven quickly accepted and followed Abbi
              to a nearby restaurant for their first date where they talked well
              into the night. The rest is history...
